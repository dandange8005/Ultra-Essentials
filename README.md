# Ultra Essentials Project
This Github repo is a folk of the Ultra Essentials Project developed by the DigEd (Digital Education) team at Cardiff University. The original project was developed with Xerte and published at [Ultra Essentials](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_18321#UltraEssentials). The aim of this folk is to see if we can use Github to host the project but also to enhance the current workflow.

With that in mind, we have a few objectives we'd like to achieve:

1. To make the project more accessible to the DigEd team as well as the wider community of learning technologists and educators.
2. To take advantages of Git and Github such as branches, version control, issue tracking, and pull requests to enhance the current workflow.
3. To use static site generator such as [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to publish the changes automatically. The static website will be hosted on Github Pages and published here https://dandange8005.github.io/ultra-essentials/.


## Contributing to the project

One of the aims of the project is to introduce a new workflow that encourages collaboration, contributions, and version control for resource development. By using Github, we are hoping to implement a system for team members and external contributors to suggest edits, improvements, and additions to the resources. 

Contributions from within the organisation and outside the organisation are welcome. The following steps are recommended for contributing to the project.

Different ways of contributing to the project:

- Raise an issue
- Request to be a contributor (link to a form) (within the team)
- [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (outside the team)
