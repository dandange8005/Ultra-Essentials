# Ultra Essentials Project
This Github repo is a folk of the Ultra Essentials Project developed by the DigEd (Digital Education) team at Cardiff University. The original project is developed with Xerte and published at [Ultra Essentials](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_18321#UltraEssentials) website. The aim of this folk is to host the project on Github with the following objectives:

1. To make the project more accessible to the DigEd team as well as the wider community of learning technologists and educators.
2. To enable the features of Github such as version control, issue tracking, and pull requests.
3. To convert the original project to a static website using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The static website will be hosted on Github Pages and published here https://dandange8005.github.io/ultra-essentials/.
