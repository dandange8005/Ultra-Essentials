## Introduction

This Github repo is a folk of the Ultra Essentials Project developed by the DigEd (Digital Education) team at Cardiff University. The original project was developed with Xerte and published at [Ultra Essentials](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_18321#UltraEssentials). The aim of this folk is to see if we can use MKDocs + GitHub as an alternative solution to improve the current workflow.

With that in mind, there are a few objectives I'd like to achieve:

1. To make the project more accessible to the DigEd team as well as the wider community of learning technologists and educators.
2. To take advantages of Git and Github such as branches, version control, issue tracking, and pull requests to enhance the current workflow.
3. To use static site generator such as [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to publish the changes automatically.
