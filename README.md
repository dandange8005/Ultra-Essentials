# Ultra Essentials Project
This Github repo is a folk of the Ultra Essentials Project developed by the DigEd (Digital Education) team at Cardiff University. The original project was developed with Xerte and published at [Ultra Essentials](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_18321#UltraEssentials). The aim of this folk is to see if we can use Git and Github as an alternative solution to improve the current workflow.

With that in mind, there are a few objectives I'd like to achieve:

1. To make the project more accessible to the DigEd team as well as the wider community of learning technologists and educators.
2. To take advantages of Git and Github such as branches, version control, issue tracking, and pull requests to enhance the current workflow.
3. To use static site generator such as [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to publish the changes automatically. Here is an example of what the published project looks like: https://dandange8005.github.io/ultra-essentials/.


## Contributing to the project

One of the aims of this project is to introduce a new workflow that encourages collaboration, contributions, and version control for resource development and documentation. By using Git and Github, we are hoping to implement a system for team members and external contributors to suggest edits, improvements, and additions to the resources. 

Contributions from within the organisation and outside the organisation are welcome. The following steps are recommended for contributing to the project.

Different ways of contributing to the project:

- Raise an issue
- Request to be a contributor (link to a form) (within the team)
- [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (outside the team)

For more information on how to contribute to the project, please see the [[contribution guide]].

## Why Git and Github?

When we think about version control, we often think about software development. However, version control can be used for any type of project that involves multiple people working on the same files. It is a great way to keep track of changes and to collaborate with others.

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and folders. It is a distributed version control system which means that every user has a copy of the repository on their local machine. This allows users to work on the project offline and then push the changes to the remote repository when they are ready.

Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a web-based graphical interface and access control for repositories. It also provides additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.

### Learning Git and Github

This is not a tutorial on how to use Git and Github. If you are new to Git and Github, we recommend that you learn the basics before contributing to the project.

There are many resources available for learning Git and Github. Here are a few that we recommend:

- [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Learn Git](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-git.html)
- [Learn Git with Bitbucket Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud)
- [Version Control with Git](https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git)
- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - most visual and interactive way to learn Git on the web
- [Git Immersion](https://gitimmersion.com/) - a guided tour that walks through the fundamentals of Git
### Tools for Git

- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Why NOT Xerte

Though Xerte is a great tool for creating online resources, it is not ideal for creating documentations. Xerte doesn't come with a lot of features that are essential for creating documentations. 

For example:

- Xerte doesn't support Markdown syntax
- Xerte doesn't support version control
- Xerte doesn't support collaboration in a way that is easy to know who is working on what
- Xerte doesn't support search
- Xerte doesn't support localisation nativly
- Xerte Bootstrap template doesn't support multi-level navigation
