# Module Staff Lists 

The main course Instructors are listed at the top left of the Course Content page. Only key academic staff should be displayed here. Staff with the Instructor role will be shown, with any Primary Instructors at the top of the list. Admin staff should be enrolled as TA to avoid appearing in this area. 

In addition, all course staff and students are shown in the Class Register. Here you can drill down into profile information for staff and analytics information for students. Principle module staff and link to Class Register

It is possible to use these two areas to replace staff list documents altogether, if they are configured correctly.

- Only staff with the Instructor role are listed under Course Staff - so the main academic staff should be enrolled as Instructor and support staff as TA. 
- The course lead should be marked as Primary Instructor in the Class Register (see below), so that they appear at the top of the Course Staff list. 
- Clicking on the profile picture or the Envelope icons in the Course Staff list allows staff to send a Message to other staff in Ultra.

!!! note "Please note" 

    You won't see an envelope icon by your name as you can't send a message to yourself! Students cannot use the Message feature at this time.

Click on Class Register to view all staff and students on the module:

The Class Register is where you can:

- View staff members' profile information. (See Your Personal Profile to learn how to update your profile and make it available to students)
- View students' progress and marks
- Set the Primary Instructor (so that they appear at the top of the list on the first page)
