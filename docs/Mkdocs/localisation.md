Another feature I am hoping to add is the ability to add an alternative language to the docs. Although Material MkDocs does come with a localisation feature and is documented [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-language/#site-language-selector), I am not sure how to use it yet. I will update this section once I have figured it out.

## Using the plugin

I came across this plugin [mkdocs-static-i18n](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n) which seems to be able to do what I want. I will try to use it and see if it works.

There is a also a video tutorial on how to use it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pYN6Z-t1-s&t=504s&ab_channel=EuroPythonConference)
