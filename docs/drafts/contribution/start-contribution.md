# Simple Guide for Documentation Contributors

Welcome! This guide will help you start contributing to our documentation, even if you have no technical background. We'll use GitHub's web interface, which means you won't need to install anything on your computer.

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account (free)
- A web browser
- Basic writing skills

!!! tip "New to GitHub?"
    Don't worry! We'll walk you through each step. GitHub is like Google Docs for code and documentation, where multiple people can work together.

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Follow the registration steps
4. Verify your email address

### 2. Find the Documentation

1. Go to our repository (we'll provide you with the link)
2. Click on the `docs` folder
3. Browse through the files ending in `.md` - these are our documentation files

!!! info "What are .md files?"
    `.md` files are Markdown files - they're like simple text files that can be formatted nicely. Don't worry, you'll only need to learn a few basic formatting rules!

## Making Your First Contribution

### 1. Find Something to Improve

Look for:

- Typos
- Unclear explanations
- Outdated information
- Missing information
- Grammar mistakes

### 2. Make the Change

1. Navigate to the file you want to change
2. Click the ✏️ (pencil) icon at the top right of the file
3. Make your changes in the editor
4. Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section
5. Add a brief description of what you changed
6. Click "Propose changes"

!!! success "That's it!"
    You've just created what's called a "Pull Request" - it's like suggesting an edit in Google Docs.

## Basic Formatting Guide

Here are the most common formatting rules you'll need:

```markdown
# Big Heading
## Smaller Heading

Normal text goes here.

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another bullet point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

[Link text](https://example.com)
```

## Tips for Good Contributions

1. **Start Small**
   - Fix a typo
   - Clarify a sentence
   - Add a missing example

2. **One Change at a Time**
   - Focus on one improvement per contribution
   - This makes it easier to review and approve

3. **Be Clear**
   - Explain what you changed and why
   - Use simple language

## Getting Help

If you need help:
1. Look at existing documentation for examples
2. Ask in the discussions section
3. Create an issue explaining what you're trying to do

## Common Questions

### "I'm afraid of making mistakes!"
Don't worry! Your changes won't affect the live documentation until they're reviewed and approved. You can't break anything!

### "What if I don't know how to format something?"
Look at other files in the documentation for examples, or just write the content and note in your pull request that you need help with formatting.

### "How do I know if my contribution is useful?"
If you found something unclear or incorrect, others probably did too. Your perspective as a newcomer is valuable!

## What NOT to Worry About

- Don't worry about perfect formatting
- Don't worry about making mistakes
- Don't worry if you need to ask questions
- Don't worry about technical terms you don't understand

## Simple Markdown Examples

### Adding a Note

    This is an important note.
```

```markdown
Here's a [link to the homepage](index.md)
```
