You can also set **exceptions** to adjust the window when specific assignments are available or give additional attempts to specific students.

    The difference between the two is that accommodations are applied to all assessments in an entire course, while exceptions are applied to individual assessments.


## Granting Accommodations
Student accommodations allow you to grant more time for students to finish their work during timed assessments.

To add an accommodation for a student, you can access it from two places:

- From the Class Register
- From the Gradebook

### From Class Register

1. Navigate to the Class Register
2. Select the student you wish to grant an accommodation to
3. click on the ellipsis (three dots) next to the student's name
4. Select **Accommodations**

You have the option to set **Due date accommodations** and **Time limit accommodations**.

Once a student has been granted an accommodation, a symbol will appear next to their name in the Class Register. You can also click on the accommodation link to view or amend the accommodations in details.

## Granting Exceptions

Exceptions allow you to grant additional attempts or an alternative availability window for individual students to access a test. Please note this availability window is not a timer, but the period in which the test is visible to students in the module.

To add an exception for a student, you can access it from two places:

- From the Assessment > Submissions Tab > Click on the ellipsis (three dots) next to the student's name > Add or edit exceptions
- From the Gradebook > Select the assessment > Submissions Tab > Click on the ellipsis (three dots) next to the student's name > Add or edit exceptions
