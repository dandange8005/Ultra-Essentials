Before building your course in Ultra, and throughout the process of designing and creating content and activities within the online environment, you should consider accessibility.

We need to ensure that our teaching and learning activities, our online learning environment, and our resources, are accessible to our diverse community of learners and to design out any barriers that may prevent learners from achieving their full potential.

You will find advice about accessibility throughout this guidance, but a few overall pointers are highlighted below:

## Ally alternative formats

Ultra's integrated accessibility helper, [Ally](https://help.blackboard.com/Ally/Ally_for_LMS/Instructor), will generate alternative versions of your content in alternative formats, for example audio, electoronic braille or translation. These will automatically be available to students alongside the original content. 

Click on the Ally icon by content items to download alternative formats:

## Use an accessibility checker 

Automatic accessibility checkers can highlight some of the more common accessibility issues, and remind you of things you may have missed. Word and Powerpoint have the Microsoft Accessibility Checker built in.

Ultra has and integrated accessibility helper, Ally 

Ally measures the accessibility of each file attached to your course and shows you at-a-glance how it scores. Scores range from Low to Perfect. The higher the score the fewer the issues.

- **Low**: File is not accessible and needs immediate attention.
- **Medium**: File is somewhat accessible and could use improvement
- **High**: File is accessible but could be improved.
- **Perfect**: File is accessible. No improvement needed.

For files with Low to High scores, Ally shows you the issues and gives a step-by-step guide on how to fix them.

## Provide content, and clear instructions, in advance

Post your resources well ahead of live sessions. Set out clearly how students should engage in advance of and during the session. Describe options and alternatives (providing as much flexibility as you can). This will help students with a wide range of needs by providing clarity and additional time to prepare.


## Create accessible content

### Use headers and styles in the application you are using, for example:

Styles in Blackboard - these can found in the top left of the content editor - you can include a title, header, subheader or paragraph.

### Choose colours and formatting with accessibility in mind

Ensure there is sufficient contrast between text and background, but avoid very high contrast (for example, use a dark grey on an off-white background). Use a simple sans serif font (the default font is often best). Avoid italics, block capitals or underlining; use bold for emphasis only. Left-justify your text. While it is tempting to focus only on aesthetics, these formatting choices can benefit a range of learners, including both visually impaired and neurodiverse students.

### Always add alternative text ('alt text') to images

Use images selectively, and describe the appearance and function of each image. Many applications have specific 'alt text' functionality, otherwise you can add it alongside the image. This can particularly help those with visual impairments as the 'alt text' can be read by screen reader software, which cannot access the image contents otherwise (this is why text within images is inaccessible). 

Adding Alt text in Blackboard - when you add an image into the content editor in Ultra, you will be presented with file options - this includes a space to enter alternative text. If your image is purely decorative you should tick the relevant check box - this will tell screenreaders to ignore this image.
