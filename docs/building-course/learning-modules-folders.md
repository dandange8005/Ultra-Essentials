# Planning Your Content - Learning Modules and Folders

The main structure of an Ultra course is in the **Content area**, organised within **Learning Modules** and **Folders**.

- **Learning Modules** are a special type of folder designed for collections of learning materials and activities. Students navigate sequentially through a linear structure, almost like an e-book, enhancing the 'flow' of reading and learning. 
  - We recommend organising Ultra course materials within learning modules by week, topic, session, etc, as appropriate. 
  - Learning modules can contain folders if it helps to organise large amounts of content. 
- **Folders** are simply used to gather together multiple files in a single 'container'. We recommend placing module-wide reference materials and useful resources in a top level folder. 

!!! note "Please Note"
    It is vital that you map out in advance how your content will be structured and organised, ideally in consultation with other colleagues/module leads on your programme. This will ensure a consistent approach and greatly enhance usability for both students and staff. 

## Using learning modules

A learning module allows you to gather together multiple files but, unlike a folder, allows students to navigate left and right in a linear manner, if desired, between content items. We recommend using learning modules where students progress through content in a particular order.  

You can create one more level of folders inside a Learning Module. These will also have sequential navigation. 

To create a learning module:

- Navigate to where you want the new learning module, and hover your cursor in that location. Click the purple '+' that will appear.

- Select 'Create' and then select 'Learning module'.
- Click on the default name ('New Learning Module..') to rename it to something that accurately explains what the folder is for. 
- Add to the description field with clear, concise information describing what the content item is about, who it is for and what it contains. 
- If you want students to access this content immediately (or as soon as they have access to the module) change the drop-down option from 'Hidden from students' to 'Visible to students'.
- Tick the 'Forced Sequence' option if you want to ensure students work through the learning module in the required order.
- Select 'Save' - your new folder will now appear.

!!! tip "Helpful Hint"
    when creating new learning modules items, always rename them and complete the description fields.  This helps students understand what content is without having to access it.

## Using folders

As you would expect, a folder is simply a collection of files and other items. Folders can be expanded and collapsed to make navigation easier. However, once a user accesses an item inside a folder they need to close it before navigating to the next piece of content.

Folders work well for resources that students are more likely to access as a point of reference, as and when required (e.g. module information, assessment information).

You can create **two levels** of folders to organize your content. To create a folder:

- Navigate to where you want the new folder, and hover your cursor in that location. Click the purple '+' that will appear.

- Select 'Create' and then select 'Folder'.
- Click on the default name ('New Folder...') to rename it to something that accurately explains what the folder is for. 
- Add to the description field with clear, concise information describing what the content item is about, who it is for and what it contains. 
- If you want students to access this content immediately (or as soon as they have access to the module) change the drop-down option from 'Hidden from students' to 'Visible to students'.
- Select 'Save' - your new folder will now appear.

## Cardiff Template - Best Practice Example

Your new Ultra modules will be created with a basic Cardiff University template. This includes an **About your Module** folder and an **Assessment & Feedback** folder at the top, followed by a sequence of Learning Modules.

It is recommended that you use the top two folders for module-wide information such as a module handbook and reading list, together with all the module assessment information and summative submission points. This will give students consistency across modules so they can always easily find this information. 

Following on from these, the learning modules will contain the main learning materials, and enable students to work through a flow of content. These can be broken down either on a week-by-week basis, or another structure that makes logical sense in the context of your module. 

Below is an example of a structure that will help students navigate with ease and guide them through their learning content.
