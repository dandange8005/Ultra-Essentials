 # Import and export groups in Ultra

This resource covers the different aspects needed to successfully import your group sets, groups and students.


## Why import?

Whenever we are dealing with large cohorts and they need to be split into groups, it’s preferable to do what’s called a batch enrolment. This both saves time and minimises the risk of user error.

## What do I need?

In order to enrol your student(s) into their group(s) you need to first create your Group Set(s) and Group(s).

If you are starting from scratch you can [download a sample file](https://learningcentral.cf.ac.uk/webapps/bb-group-mgmt-LEARN/help/ultra/sample_groups.csv). In the event you are going to be doing this a multitude of times, it’s recommended you rename it from its default name to a more unique identifier e.g. the module code.

The sample file has different column headers which can be described as such:

*Any columns with the asterisk(*) are mandatory to fill out.*

**Group Code*:** The unique identifier for the group. It doesn’t show anywhere so you could call it Group 1, Group 2, Group 3 etc. for simplicity’s sake. The important thing is that it needs to be unique for each group within the Group Set.
