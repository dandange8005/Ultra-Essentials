It is possible to add a test at any point in an Ultra module. It is good practice to first create your questions in a Question Bank.

It is recommended that all summative tests should be placed in the Assessment and Feedback folder, however formative tests may be added at any point.

## Create a Test

At any point in an Ultra module, click on the plus sign and choose 'Create', followed by 'Test':

On the following page:

1. Give your new test a name
2. Click on the plus sign to add questions
3. Best practice is to choose Add Question Pool (see Quick Start Guide below for more details). You will then be able choose which questions to use from your Question Banks, and decide how many of them to randomly display in the Test. If you edit a question from a Question Pool, the edit will propagate through to everywhere the question appears.
4. Alternatively, it is also possible to create new questions directly in a Test. 
5. You can also choose to Reuse Questions (from Question Banks or other tests). In this case, a copy will be created in the new Test which can then be edited independently of the original.
6. Here you can adjust the most commonly used settings directly on the Test page - such as the due date and the number of attempts allowed. (More details on the blackboard website.)
7. The full Test Settings page can be accessed by selecting the cog icon at the top-right.  The blackboard website contains descriptions of all the different options available when setting up a test
8. By default, a new test will be hidden from students. You can make it visible here.  

At the end of any test, there is an option to allow students to add additional content, such as text or uploaded files. This is currently switched ON by default. For automatically marked tests, it is strongly recommended that you click the slider to switch this function OFF, to avoid confusion.
