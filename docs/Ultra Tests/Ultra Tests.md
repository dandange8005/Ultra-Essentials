Tests in Ultra allow you to build automatically graded assessments with a range of question types. Tests are a particularly useful way to provide formative assessment and feedback to learners. They can also be used for some types of summative assessment. 

You can add a Test at any point in a sequence of learning materials in a Learning Module or Folder. It is good practice to first create your Questions in a Question Bank. 

The range of question types available in Ultra is slightly more restricted than in Original Courses: 

- Multiple Choice
- Multiple Answer
- Matching Questions
- True/False
- Fill in the Blank
- Fill in Multiple Blanks
- Calculated Formula
- Calculated Numeric
- Essay Questions
- Hotspot Questions

All of these question types are graded automatically, except for Essay Questions which need to be manually marked.
