Before creating a Test it is good practice to create your questions in a Question Bank - although it is also possible to create questions directly in a standalone Test if you wish.  

Question Banks contain master copies of questions which will persist even if the Test using them is deleted. They allow you to organise questions by topic, LO, etc. and to build up a library of questions over time without fear of inadvertently deleting a test, or students having access to them unintentionally.

Then there are two ways of adding questions from a Question Bank to a Test: 

- You can add a Pool of questions to a test from a Question Bank. You can decide how many of these questions to randomly display in the Test. Questions in a Pool are not copies, but remain directly linked to the originals in the Question Bank.
- Alternatively, you can copy individual questions to a Test from a Question Bank. This creates copies of the questions which can be edited without affecting the original.

If you have created tests without Question Banks, or imported tests from other courses, you can later consolidate the questions into Question Banks if you wish.
