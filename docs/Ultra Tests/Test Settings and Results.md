When you create a test, the Settings give you fine control of how it is presented to students.

- In the Test Settings, you can set due dates, time limits, etc
- You can decide when (and whether) you want to release the results to students, and with what feedback. 
- When you create a test, a Gradebook item is created automatically. 
- Both faculty and students can access results and feedback either through the Gradebook or from the original test. 

## Test Settings

When you create a test, use Settings to control how it is presented to students - due dates, feedback, submission views, optional time limits, etc.

The panel on the right of the test page gives quick access to some of the most frequently used settings, such as the due date and the number of attempts allowed. The full Settings page (with all the options) can be accessed through the cog icon:

Through the settings page, you can decide at a granular level exactly what [submission views and feedback](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Ultra/Tests_Pools_Surveys/Test_and_Survey_Options) to release to students. 
 
The blackboard website contains [explanations of all the different options available](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Ultra/Tests_Pools_Surveys/Create_Tests_and_Surveys#ultra_new_test_page).

## Releasing results to students

Under Test Settings, you can decide when (and whether) to allow students to view their submissions and results:

If you need to manually post results to students:

- Open "Gradebook" for the module
- find your test in the "Markable Items" list
- select the "Post marks" button. 
 
You will be able to access test attempts either through the Gradebook or through the 'Submissions' link at the top right of the Test page:
