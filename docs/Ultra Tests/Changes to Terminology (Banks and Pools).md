## Changes to Terminology

If you have used Tests in Original, you should be aware of the following changes to terminology in Ultra.

| Original Course View (old) | Ultra Course View (new) |
| --- | --- |
| Random block and question set | Question pool |
| Question pool | Question bank |

**Question Banks** store questions for use within a module, and should usually be created before Tests. You can also import existing banks (formerly pools) from Original modules (see Migrating from Original - Importing a Pool from Original).

**Question Pools** allow you to serve different questions to students sitting the same test.
