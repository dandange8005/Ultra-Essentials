Learning Central Essentials is designed as a reference for all the main tools and features available in Learning Central. It contains Quick Start Guides for the Cardiff context and links to further online help.

When rolling over modules or creating new modules, Essentials can be used in conjunction with the Learning Central Good Practice Guide, which consists of four checklists to ensure that your Learning Central modules follow the best possible practice for you and your students.
