# Demo page

<!-- This is a demo page to showcase the basic markdown syntax supported by MkDocs. You can use this page as a reference when creating your own documentation. -->

## Text formatting


This **bold text** and this *italicized text* show emphasis, while ***bold and italics together*** create stronger emphasis. You can also use __underscores__ for **bold** and _italics_. For code snippets, use `inline code` with backticks. To ~~strike through~~ text, use tildes. Create [links](https://example.com "Optional Title") easily, and even use ![image alt text](https://unsplash.it/300/200 "Optional Image Title") for images. Use 

> for blockquotes, 

and separate paragraphs with blank lines. Create ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
      - Nested unordered item
      - Another nested item

For horizontal rules, use three hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

---

For more complex formatting, use `<sup>superscript</sup>` or `<sub>subscript</sub>`, and tables:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |

Finally, you can add `#` tags for headings of different levels (H1-H6).

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

<!-- ## Linking to other pages

One of the benefit of using a markdown file is that you can easily link to other pages within the same repository. This is useful for creating a table of contents or linking to related content.

```markdown

For example, I want to write a paragraph about the benefits of using markdown files and introduce some [basic markdown syntax](basic-markdown.md). I can also create a list of items that link to the mkdocs pages:

- [[buttons]]
- [[icons-emojis]]
- [[callouts]]
