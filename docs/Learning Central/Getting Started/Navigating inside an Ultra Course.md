The new, modern user interface allows you to navigate directly to all parts of an Ultra course from the three main areas: Course Content, Top Navigation Menu and Details and Actions. 

All of your course content appears in the main part of the page. When you open a piece of content, it slides out in a layer on top of the Course Content page. Close layers to go back to a previous spot in your course.

See the video for a full overview of the interface, and the expandable links below for more details:

This is where you can view module enrolments; create and manage groups; add a module banner image; set the module availability; access, and create Blackboard Collaborate virtual classroom sessions; post announcements; manage test question banks; and add a module schedule.
4. **Student Preview** - Visible to staff only. Staff can use this tool to see how their course will look and function to students.

    The addition of instructor functionality, allowing staff to check student progress, is planned for later in 2022.

**Course is open / private / completed** - Visible to staff only. You can use this tool to set the course availability.

**Blackboard Collaborate** - You can use Blackboard Collaborate to set up, run, and manage synchronous online classroom sessions, meetings, tutorials, etc. Students use this tool to join these sessions, and access session recordings.

**Attendance** - If you register attendance in your course, this is where you can set it up. Find out more about Attendance on Blackboard Help.

**Announcements** - You can use this tool to send announcements to all students enrolled on the course. Students will receive the announcements via email. Students will see announcements in the Activity Stream and will also see any new announcements in a pop-up window when they access the course.

**Books & Course Tools** - you will be able to find some additional tools under Books and Course Tools, such as Cardiff Pulse, Learn Plus Recordings, Leganto Reading Lists and so on.

**Question Banks** - If you use Blackboard question pools in your Original module, you can import the pool here as a Question Bank for re-use. In Ultra Courses, Pools have been replaced with Question Banks.
