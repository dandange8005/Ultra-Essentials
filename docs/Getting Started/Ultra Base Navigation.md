# Ultra Based Navigation

ULTRA navigation is designed to be intuitive - it is almost impossible to get lost in ULTRA courses!

As soon as you log in, you have access to all the core features from the main menu where your name appears. You can easily return to this menu from wherever you areâ€”even if you're in a course. The menu peeks from behind the other layers you have open.

Adding this from Labixiaonan's contribution.

## Quick Start Guide - Base Navigation 

The landing page is the Activity Stream, with the latest updates from all your courses. From the main menu on the left, you can access all areas of ULTRA.
