# Ultra Feature Friday

## 07-Jun-2024 03900.93.0

So, Ultra Features Friday this week is focussing on release [03900.93.0](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0") that was released yesterday with more tweaks and interface refinements in preparation for the big update in July/August: 

- [AI Design Assistant – output language selector](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-1 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-1") - whilst not enabled just yet, given that we are going to turn on aspects of the AI Design Assistant over the Summer thought I'd mention this.  Basically it allows staff to select a desired language when asking AI to create content for them.  Obviously the accuracy won't be 100% and would need to be proofread afterwards, but a nice addition nevertheless.
- ❤️ [Printing for assessments](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-2 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-2") - this was another feature we asked for, this allows staff to be able to provide physical printed or PDF copies of a test if required.  This means that staff could in theory ask students to undertake a test both online and on paper in a physical location, or in the event of a technical failure during the exam, they could provide paper copies quickly and easily.
- [Post immediately when creating announcements](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-5 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-5") - another feature we've asked for, staff can now post announcements straight away and not have to click the 'post' button on the announcement page.  They still can save as draft and post later, but just basically removes an additional action and mouse click to publish that sometimes staff might forget to do.
- [Prevent auto-assigning members within self-enrollment groups](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-6 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-6") - before this update Blackboard would auto assign any student unenrolled to self enrolment groups which was inconvenient, especially for students that had left the course/module but not had been processed yet.  Now staff have to opt in to this process is they want auto assignments to happen.
- [Group members list available in the selected group](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-7 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-7") - this just allows staff to be able to see what students are in what groups via a drop down instead of navigating to a separate tab.
- [Filter out graded responses when grading by question](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-8 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-8") - this has been asked for by a few staff in Cardiff, and is especially useful when marking large cohorts.  Now staff can filter out any students that have already had their question graded in the question by question view of the flexible grading interface.  Very useful considering the page loading impact on modules with 100s of students.
- ❤️  [Grader Notes on student grades](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-9 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-9") - grader notes has returned!  Although this was already available in original this function is now reinstated allowing markers to put private notes about student's work whilst grading is taking place - very useful for work being second marked or has multiple markers per assignment.
- [Improved visibility of new grades and feedback in the student gradebook](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-10 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-10") - now when students access a module they clearly get to see how many new marks they have in the Gradebook tab at the top with the title being appended with a purple number of how many new grades they have not seen before.  Useful for just notifying students when new feedback has appeared, especially if they ignore the Activity Stream and emails.
- [Return a true/false question to an unanswered state](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-4 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-4") - a detail I asked for a couple of years back, now students can revert true/false questions in tests back to an answered state, which to be honest should have been the case originally as any student might want to change their mind and abstain from an answer if they're unsure and don't want to risk getting a wrong answer.
- [Base Navigation – Course and Organization filters and personalization](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-14 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-14") - now instead of of the left right navigation buttons on courses and organisations flicking between this year and previous years they have implemented much more straight forward filtering.  Something which I know a lot for staff and student used to get confused with, especially around rollover so when new modules wouldn't appear, or they'd lost old modules., so this is a welcome addition, especially with rollover looming!
