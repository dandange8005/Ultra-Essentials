# Ultra Feature Friday

## 07-Jun-2024 03900.93.0

So, Ultra Features Friday this week is focussing on release [03900.93.0](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0") that was released yesterday with more tweaks and interface refinements in preparation for the big update in July/August: 

- [AI Design Assistant – output language selector](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-1 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-1") - whilst not enabled just yet, given that we are going to turn on aspects of the AI Design Assistant over the Summer thought I'd mention this.  Basically it allows staff to select a desired language when asking AI to create content for them.  Obviously the accuracy won't be 100% and would need to be proofread afterwards, but a nice addition nevertheless.
- ❤️ [Printing for assessments](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-2 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-2") - this was another feature we asked for, this allows staff to be able to provide physical printed or PDF copies of a test if required.  This means that staff could in theory ask students to undertake a test both online and on paper in a physical location, or in the event of a technical failure during the exam, they could provide paper copies quickly and easily.
- [Post immediately when creating announcements](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-5 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-5") - another feature we've asked for, staff can now post announcements straight away and not have to click the 'post' button on the announcement page.  They still can save as draft and post later, but just basically removes an additional action and mouse click to publish that sometimes staff might forget to do.
- [Prevent auto-assigning members within self-enrollment groups](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-6 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-6") - before this update Blackboard would auto assign any student unenrolled to self enrolment groups which was inconvenient, especially for students that had left the course/module but not had been processed yet.  Now staff have to opt in to this process is they want auto assignments to happen.
- [Group members list available in the selected group](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-7 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-7") - this just allows staff to be able to see what students are in what groups via a drop down instead of navigating to a separate tab.
- [Filter out graded responses when grading by question](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-8 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-8") - this has been asked for by a few staff in Cardiff, and is especially useful when marking large cohorts.  Now staff can filter out any students that have already had their question graded in the question by question view of the flexible grading interface.  Very useful considering the page loading impact on modules with 100s of students.
- ❤️  [Grader Notes on student grades](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-9 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-9") - grader notes has returned!  Although this was already available in original this function is now reinstated allowing markers to put private notes about student's work whilst grading is taking place - very useful for work being second marked or has multiple markers per assignment.
- [Improved visibility of new grades and feedback in the student gradebook](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-10 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-10") - now when students access a module they clearly get to see how many new marks they have in the Gradebook tab at the top with the title being appended with a purple number of how many new grades they have not seen before.  Useful for just notifying students when new feedback has appeared, especially if they ignore the Activity Stream and emails.
- [Return a true/false question to an unanswered state](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-4 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-4") - a detail I asked for a couple of years back, now students can revert true/false questions in tests back to an answered state, which to be honest should have been the case originally as any student might want to change their mind and abstain from an answer if they're unsure and don't want to risk getting a wrong answer.
- [Base Navigation – Course and Organization filters and personalization](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.93.0-14 "https://help.blackboard.com/learn/administrator/saas/release_notes#3900.93.0-14") - now instead of of the left right navigation buttons on courses and organisations flicking between this year and previous years they have implemented much more straight forward filtering.  Something which I know a lot for staff and student used to get confused with, especially around rollover so when new modules wouldn't appear, or they'd lost old modules., so this is a welcome addition, especially with rollover looming!

## 03-May-2024 - 03900.91.0

- ❤️ [Supporting multiple performance criteria in release conditions](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-2) - this has been requested a handful of times where multiple criteria need to be fulfilled by a student before making other content available.  This will be very useful when trying to ensure a set level of understanding is attained in several topic areas before progressing to other parts of the course.  That said, it must be noted this initial iteration only allows for building up of criteria using 'AND' to link them, i.e. if date/time is midday on 3rd May 'AND' student has achieved 80% or higher then make this content available.  I imagine that 'OR' will come in future allowing for a wider range of requirements, i.e. if date/time is midday on 3rd May 'AND' student has achieved 80% or higher in Assessment A 'OR' 80% or higher in Assessment B then make this content available; so watch this space.  It's also worth noting that the performance criteria takes on the grade format dynamically for that selected assignment, so if an assessment is points-based that criteria will be in points and if the selected assessment is graded as a percentage then it will display out of a percentage for that part of the criteria.
- [Reuse questions in Forms](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-4) - this just replicates last month's feature of reusing questions within the same assessment only in the Forms content item as well.  Useful for quickly replicating similar questions allowing for slight tweaks between them to help create forms more quickly.
- [Multiple attempts for Forms assigned to groups](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-5) - previously when assigning a Form to groups it would only allow for a single attempt for some reason, as of this release you can select multiple attempts if required.
- [Gradebook view navigation buttons are changing](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-8) - so this changes the current list view and grid view graphic icons in the Gradebook to text-based links, whilst being better for accessibility, the change might initially confuse staff.  From today a link to 'Markable items' now replaces the list icon and a link to 'Marks' replaces the grid icon.  There is also a 'Students' link to give a list of all students with overall mark displayed as well.  Whilst a minor user interface change, guaranteed this will confuse some staff in the beginning so it's worth bearing in mind.  This also means we have to change our support documentation and videos with regards navigating around the Gradebook
- [Add question feedback when grading a test by question](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-7) - this allows staff to be able to give bespoke feedback to students on a per question basis in addition any per question automated feedback.  This was supposed to be implemented with the last release but got delayed to this month.
- ❤️ [Weighted Calculation Improvements](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-9) - now instructors can assign equal weightings to items in the same categories in Gradebook calculated columns. The chosen calculation method, whether proportional or equal, applies to all categories, but can be additionally configured. In the past, weighted items in the same category had proportional weights. These weighted items were based on the possible points of each item.  This should just allow for easier and more accurate distribution of even weightings across multiple assessments of the same type/category.
- ❤️ [Restricting Original Course View Copy workflow](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-17) - this will now prevent staff from being able to 'push' content from an original course to an Ultra course.  They will still be able to copy from an original course to Ultra, but only invoking the process from within Ultra, 'pulling' content across, not the other way around.  Whilst this was the only workaround when the original -> Ultra copy function broke last month this limitation is a bid to prevent Ultra courses from getting corrupted and negate the need for the original -> Ultra 'push' process as it was designed to be pull only.
- [Align goals to questions in question pools](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-1) - staff can now align questions to goals.  We don't use goals here in Cardiff, but one school are looking to potentially trial this as it can be especially useful for competency based teaching or courses with strict PSRB requirements.  With the ['learning mastery' enhancements coming over the Summer](https://cf.sharepoint.com/:i:/r/teams/DigitalLearningEnvironment/Shared%20Documents/4.08%20Ultra%20Rollout%20Technical/Learning%20Mastery.png?csf=1&web=1&e=b1DDgl) that could see the goals utilised across the University, hence mentioning it even though it can't be used right now, so this is just more an FYI.
- ❤️ [Set the size limit for file type uploads to zero](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-13) - system administrators (Basically Uni IT) can now set certain file sizes on defined file types to zero.  Although not enforced yet, this could see file size limited on things such as videos forcing staff to use Panopto for storing and linking to videos instead of Blackboard which is not a video streaming server and offers an inferior student experience when watching videos back.  If these limits do start to get enforced I will let you know.
- [Reduced motion setting](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.91.0-12) - some users prefer to have reduced animations on websites as they find them distracting or could affect the performance of their device.  This feature now means that Blackboard will take on whatever the user's system settings are in their Accessibility motion preferences, so any windows that previously 'swiped in' from the right will just appear if they have reduced or removed animation effects selected/disabled.  These system settings can be found in:

	- iOS: Accessibility > Motion > Reduce motion (on)
	- Android: Settings > Accessibility > Remove Animations (on)
	- Windows: Settings > Accessibility > Visual effects > Animation effects (off)
	- Mac OS: System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion (on)

 ## 03-Apr-2024 03900.89.0

 - [Default question points value changed from 10 to 1](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-5) - FINALLY the default mark when creating new questions in a test or assignment will be 1, not 10. Personally it was a daft default decision in the first place so a welcome addition as most questions would start as 1 point and then get scaled up by the Academic manually if needed. This also prevents staff from manually having to adjust MCQs from 10 points to 1 every time they create a new one which was quite annoying.
- [Duplicate questions in Assessments, Forms, and Question Banks](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-6) - this will allow staff to be able to reuse questions from within the same test/assignment, form or q-bank whilst creating it. This re-introduces much needed functionality that existed in original so good to have it back. This will mean that staff can duplicate questions that have similar stems or answers more quickly just with minor tweaking rather than using the reuse question interface or creating from scratch and copying and pasting stems and/or answers.
- [Likert answer options expanded to include 4 and 6](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-7) - this now increases Likert questions to have scale ranges of 4 and 6 options, whereas before they only offered 3, 5 and 7. Please bear in mind that the Likert question type is only available for Forms, not tests or assignments.
- [Auto-submitted indicator in attempt logs](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-8) - further enhancing the attempt logs introduced a few months back they will now log if an attempt was auto-submitted (if that option is set in the test or assignment of course). This will be great for making the distinction between students who have manually submitted their work or those who ran right up until the deadline or even ran out of time.
- [Overall grade information added to gradebook download](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-13) - not sure why this was omitted in the first place. Now the overall grade for a module/course can be added to a gradebook download/export CSV report so no need for using Excel formula to work out overall module marks.
- [Individual date adjustments from Batch Edit](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-24) - staff will have the option to bulk change the due date and availability dates (Show On and Hide After) for any item through the Batch editor interface (Top right corner ellipses in each course), not just show/hide/delete.
- ❤️ [Student feedback remains visible to students regardless of release condition settings](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-4) - ok so this is a difficult one to explain, so I'll try my best. Sometimes staff might want to hide a submission portal for an assignment to prevent further submissions, whilst still allowing students to be able to see their mark once posted. The new update now allows staff to hide an assignment submission link using release conditions whilst still enabling the mark to be available if already posted. Students will of course still not be able to see the submitted assessment feedback (If hidden by release conditions) so we wouldn't recommend this is used except for very specific instances whereby the original submission portal cannot be accessible, but the marks can be. Ideally students would always have access to the mark and granular feedback concurrently so this functionality should only be used as a temporary measure. Please note, this does not affect functionality if the assessment is manually made invisible to students using the content visibility setting (i.e. not using release conditions). Making the whole assessment manually invisible hides the item and mark completely from students so still can be used as a failsafe to totally block access to prematurely posted feedback.
- ❤️ [Anonymous posts for Discussions](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-9) - a long awaited and requested feature is being restored in Ultra from when it was last available in original. Students will be able to choose whether they want to post in a discussion board anonymously or not. That said, the onus does remain on the student to select this and could affect users if they mis-post and want to change from being named to anonymous (or vice versa) and the discussion doesn't allow for editing of comments after posting. Consequently I would not recommend that setting is used in the majority of boards created as it's more hassle than it's worth and students should generally be able to edit/delete their own responses/contributions (Unless they are credit-bearing or have a reason they need to be locked down). In addition to this, the Bb community (CU included) have asked that discussions be able to be setup as purely anonymous from the outset without the student having to select the option when posting, to which Anthology have said they're planning to implement and will update in due course when this is implemented.
- [Usability improvements for flexible grading](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-10) - in further tweaks to the flexible grading interface for Bb Assessments Anthology have now relocated the attempts drop down near the final grade 'pill' on the top right corner when viewing and assessment. In addition, they have removed the individual attempt 'pill' opting for just the final grade based on the criteria selected when multiple attempts are allowed (i.e. last attempt, first attempt, highest grade, etc.). The latter will benefit staff who have already got confused in updating the wrong 'pill' and wondering why the grade for the piece of work isn't being reflected when they've just overridden the final grade pill instead.
- ❤️ [Add question feedback when grading by student in Flexible Grading](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-11) - Bb Assignments now allow for bespoke text feedback on a per question/per student basis. Before staff could only provide bespoke contextual feedback on the assessment overall, this allows for a greater level of feedback and understanding behind the mark allocated for that question which is great.
- [Calculations changed from using BigDecimal to BigFraction](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-12) - the software library used to perform calculations in calculated columns and the overall course grade is being changed from BigDecimal to BigFraction. What this means is that for example if a course contains 3 assignments worth 22 points each and the student scores 13/22, 14/22 and 15/22, if the instructor creates a calculated column to average out these assignments, the mark would incorrectly calculate to 13.99/22. As of this update the average will calculate as 14/22 as expected. This may even help solve some issues staff have encountered with calculated columns not quite displaying correctly and offering a decimal value instead of a whole number, for those we'll have to wait and see.
- [Persistent navigation for Learning Modules](https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/SaaS/Release_Notes#3900.89.0-2) - the navigation bar will become 'sticky' and stay at the top of the screen and remains visible as students vertically scroll through content. Students will no longer need to scroll back up to the top of content to access the navigation tools if a page is particularly long.
